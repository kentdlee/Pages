<p>Welcome to Luther College and the Computer Science Department, the home of both Computer Science and
Data Science programs! I welcome visitors.
If you need to see me please consult my calendar for my office hours. If my office hours
don’t work, then email me with a time that will work but consult my calendar to see when
I am free first. And, don’t hesitate to just stop by. I am available most anytime I am not
in class between 8:30 and 3:30pm. If needed, I am happy to schedule appointments outside
my normal office hours.</p>

<h2>Interested in Learning to Program?<a class="headerlink" href="#interested-in-learning-to-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It’s never too early to learn to program. My experience has shown me that students
as early as elementary age can learn to program. They really enjoy it. But it’s not
too late to start in college or even after college either!</p>
<p>I have written several textbooks and other curricula for Computer Science. They are listed below along with
links to supplementary files that go along with the texts.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction-to-programming">
<h3>Introduction to Programming<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="figure align-right">

<p>My <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Fundamentals-Undergraduate-Computer-Science/dp/1447166418/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535166521&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=kent+lee+python">introductory text for computer programming</a>
focuses on Python programming. It introduces programming to
people with no previous experience in programming. In support of this text I have produced lectures that
are available for free on Youtube. These videos have been very popular with people learning to program. The last I
checked there were a half million views of them and I have over 3,300 subscribers. You can find the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1DE477438120C9EF">playlist for these
videos by clicking here</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/IntroToComputing">You can access the supplementary
materials for this textbook by clicking here</a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-right">
<img alt="_images/frogger.gif" src="_images/frogger.gif" />
</div>
<p>I have also written a very concise (meaning dense and more intense) introduction to Python programming through the development
of computer games - both 2D video games and board games. The online text focuses on learning to program first, followed by an
introduction to programming 2D graphics video games using Turtle Graphics and PyGame. Then it moves on to Artificial Intelligence topics like building
computer opponents for games of perfect information. Finally it concludes with an introduction to Machine Learning
and the Alpha Go Zero algorithm for teaching a neural net to play a game of perfect information (like Go, Chess,
Connect Four, Checkers, or Tic Tac Toe) without any expertise from a human and with no human interaction. Alpha Go Zero
builds extremely strong computer opponents by playing games itself and <em>teaching</em> itself to play a game.
<a class="reference external" href="https://kentdlee.github.io/SCSI/build/html/index.html">You can find this free online textbook by clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>There are two other resources that I have written for introductory programming. The site <a class="reference external" href="http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/SamplingCS">Sampling CS for Middle and
High School Students</a> contains some teaching materials that are
appropriate, and <em>fun</em>, for teaching high school and middle school students.</p>
<p>I have also created a sequence of videos for building the game of Frogger. This <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sa-s_Bd7mE&amp;list=PL8tLy_7ToXL9-Z_5GoWI_01-op8SeyN2E">playlist contains the full set of
Python Programming by Example</a> videos.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/kentdlee/Frogger">Frogger GitHub repository contains the code examples</a> that go along with
this series of lessons.</p>

<p>With Dr. Steve Hubbard, Professor Emeritus at Luther College, I have written a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Undergraduate-Computer-Science/dp/3319130714/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535166422&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kent+lee+data+structures">textbook on Data Structures and
Algorithms with Python</a>
as the programming language. This text contains the traditional second course in Computer
Science topics along with Advanced Data Structures topics that are appropriate for a third or fourth year Computer
Science undergraduate course. The text focuses on many data structures including Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Priority
Queues, Hashtables for sets and maps, and balanced search trees including AVL Trees, Splay Trees, and B-Trees.
It also includes search and sorting algorithms and heuristic search algorithms. The text addresses computational
complexity of algorithms throughout by teaching you how to recognize and analyze algorithms to determine the
behavior as the size of the data grows in an application. <a class="reference external" href="http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/CS2Plus">You can access the supplementary materials for this
text by clicking here</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="foundations-of-programming-languages">
<h3>Foundations of Programming Languages<a class="headerlink" href="#foundations-of-programming-languages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="figure align-right">
<img alt="_images/proglang.jpg" src="_images/proglang.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The implementation and specification of programming languages is an area that I really get excited about. I
have written a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Programming-Languages-Undergraduate-Computer/dp/3319707892/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535151950&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kent+lee+programming">textbook which focuses on the design and implementation of programming languages</a>.
The text contains some theory mixed with various pieces of a programming language implementation. In addition, the text
introduces the reader to virtual machines, functional programming with Standard ML, and logic programming with Prolog.</p>
<p>You can get access to <a class="reference external" href="http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/PL/">support material for the textbook at this website</a>.</p>
<p>The first part of the text introduces a virtual machine, called JCoCo, which supports a low-level programming
language and is based on the Python 3.2 virtual machine. In fact, JCoCo can execute disassembled Python 3.2 code.
You can find <a class="reference external" href="http://kentdlee.github.io/JCoCoPages">JCoCo’s website here</a>. There is a partial Java implementation
provided to students at <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/kentdlee/JCoCo">http://github.com/kentdlee/JCoCo</a>. A full version of
the JCoCo implementation is available to teachers.</p>
<p>The text also builds a compiler for a decent subset of Standard ML. The partial student version of this code
is provided at <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/kentdlee/MLComp">http://github.com/kentdlee/MLComp</a>. Again, a complete
version is available for teachers. The MLComp project includes a compiler from Standard ML to CoCo assembly language
and a type inference system written in Prolog. The complete version for teachers includes the full code for
both the compiler and the type inference system.</p>
