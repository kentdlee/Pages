Interested in Learning to Program?
------------------------------------

It's never too early to learn to program. My experience has shown me that students
as early as elementary age enjoy creating really cool programs. And it's not
too late to start in college or even after college either!

I have written several textbooks and other curricula for Computer Science. They are listed below along with
links to supplementary files that go along with the texts.

Introduction to Programming
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


.. figure:: _static/introtext.jpg
	:align: right

My `introductory text for computer programming <https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Fundamentals-Undergraduate-Computer-Science/dp/1447166418/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1535166521&sr=8-2&keywords=kent+lee+python>`_
focuses on Python programming. It introduces programming to
people with no previous experience in programming. In support of this text I have produced lectures that
are available for free on Youtube. These videos have been very popular with people learning to program. The last I
checked there were a half million views of these lectures and over 3,300 subscribers to my channel. You can find the `playlist for these
videos by clicking here <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1DE477438120C9EF>`_. `You can access the supplementary
materials for this textbook by clicking here <http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/IntroToComputing>`_.

I have also written a very concise (meaning dense and more intense) introduction to Python programming through the development
of computer games - both 2D video games and board games. The online text focuses on learning to program first, followed by an
introduction to programming 2D graphics video games using Turtle Graphics and PyGame. Then it moves on to Artificial Intelligence topics like building
computer opponents for games of perfect information. Finally it concludes with an introduction to Machine Learning
and the Alpha Go Zero algorithm for teaching a neural net to play a game of perfect information (like Go, Chess,
Connect Four, Checkers, or Tic Tac Toe) without any expertise from a human and with no human interaction. Alpha Go Zero
builds extremely strong computer opponents by playing games itself and *teaching* itself to play a game.
`You can find this free online textbook by clicking here <https://kentdlee.github.io/SCSI/build/html/index.html>`_.

There are two other resources that I have written for introductory programming. The site `Sampling CS for Middle and
High School Students <http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/SamplingCS>`_ contains some teaching materials that are
appropriate, and *fun*, for teaching high school and middle school students.

I have also created a sequence of videos for building the game of Frogger. This `playlist contains the full set of
Python Programming by Example <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sa-s_Bd7mE&list=PL8tLy_7ToXL9-Z_5GoWI_01-op8SeyN2E>`_ videos.
The `Frogger GitHub repository contains the code examples <http://github.com/kentdlee/Frogger>`_ that go along with
this series of lessons.

Data Structures and Algorithms
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. figure:: _static/datastructures.jpg
	:align: right


With Dr. Steve Hubbard, Professor Emeritus at Luther College, I have written a `textbook on Data Structures and
Algorithms with Python <https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Undergraduate-Computer-Science/dp/3319130714/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1535166422&sr=8-1&keywords=kent+lee+data+structures>`_
as the programming language. This text contains the traditional second course in Computer
Science topics along with Advanced Data Structures topics that are appropriate for a third or fourth year Computer
Science undergraduate course. The text focuses on many data structures including Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Priority
Queues, Hashtables for sets and maps, and balanced search trees including AVL Trees, Splay Trees, and B-Trees.
It also includes search and sorting algorithms and heuristic search algorithms. The text addresses computational
complexity of algorithms throughout by teaching you how to recognize and analyze algorithms to determine the
behavior as the size of the data grows in an application. `You can access the supplementary materials for this
text by clicking here <http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/CS2Plus>`_.

Foundations of Programming Languages
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. figure:: _static/proglang.jpg
	:align: right

The implementation and specification of programming languages is an area that I really get excited about. I
have written a `textbook which focuses on the design and implementation of programming languages
<https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Programming-Languages-Undergraduate-Computer/dp/3319707892/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1535151950&sr=8-1&keywords=kent+lee+programming>`_.
The text contains some theory mixed with various pieces of a programming language implementation. In addition, the text
introduces the reader to virtual machines, functional programming with Standard ML, and logic programming with Prolog.

You can get access to `support material for the textbook at this website <http://knuth.luther.edu/~leekent/PL/>`_.

The first part of the text introduces a virtual machine, called JCoCo, which supports a low-level programming
language and is based on the Python 3.2 virtual machine. In fact, JCoCo can execute disassembled Python 3.2 code.
You can find `JCoCo's website here <http://kentdlee.github.io/JCoCoPages>`_. There is a partial Java implementation
provided to students at `http://github.com/kentdlee/JCoCo <http://github.com/kentdlee/JCoCo>`_. A full version of
the JCoCo implementation is available to teachers.

The text also builds a compiler for a decent subset of Standard ML. The partial student version of this code
is provided at `http://github.com/kentdlee/MLComp <http://github.com/kentdlee/MLComp>`_. Again, a complete
version is available for teachers. The MLComp project includes a compiler from Standard ML to CoCo assembly language
and a type inference system written in Prolog. The complete version for teachers includes the full code for
both the compiler and the type inference system.

Sample Projects
-------------------
I have worked on so many projects over my time as a teacher that I thought I would share a few. Most of these
are not complete projects, but meant to serve as an introduction to some area of programming or as a start of a project for students. But, in many cases a more complete version is available upon request from other teachers. Students might also get some ideas for themselves here of projects they may be interested in developing further.

* The `JCoCo Virtual Machine (VM) <http://kentdlee.github.io/JCoCoPages>`_ and `its source code <http://github.com/kentdlee/JCoCo>`_ are one of my more recent projects. Much can be done to extend this virtual machine for parallel computation, GUI programming, or a myriad of other projects. Most recently I added some Turtle Graphics to the virtual machine.

* The `MLComp Project <http://github.com/kentdlee/MLComp>`_ is a full-blown Standard ML compiler that compiles to the JCoCo VM and has a type checker written in Prolog. The project uses a Standard ML scanner and parser generator to produce an abstract syntax tree (AST) of a source program and then has a code generator that produces JCoCo VM code. This project could be extended to include even more of the Standard ML language, or it could be used as the basis for building an oCaML compiler. If you were interested in this project, a more complete version of the MLComp compiler is available upon request.

* The `AlphaZero Project <http://github.com/kentdlee/alpha-zero-general>`_ is a clone of `Surag Nair's project <https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general>`_. In this I took Surag's Alpha Zero Neural Net for playing Tic Tac Toe and added a GUI front-end to it so it could be played against by a human. This could be taken further to add a GUI front-end to the Connect Four neural net but some work would be required to get all of this to work together. I have a GUI front-end that could communicate with the neural net backend in much the same way that the Tic Tac Toe project works (through a pipe and a well-defined architecture).

* The `GoBackN Project <http://cs.luther.edu/~leekent/Networking/GoBackN.html>`_ is an example of a project that I developed when teaching Computer Networking. The project includes several parts of the code. A full solution is available upon request. The project incorporates an implementation of a Socket class and implements TCP over UDP as a means of learning the difference between guaranteed, reliable end to end service with TCP and the unguaranteed service of UDP.

* The `Theory of Computation <http://cs.luther.edu/~leekent/ComputationalModels>`_ site contains several projects that are based on building a bottom-up parser generator and a scanner. These projects involve building finite state machines from regular expressions and building a parser from a context-free grammar. These are projects I first worked on during the summer of 1984 (when I was a college student) and have lived on when I rewrote them in Python for use in my Computational Models course. All the code for these projects is complete and is available upon request. The complete project is a full blown compiler generator written in Python.

There have been other projects in the areas of Computer Graphics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Database Systems, Operating Systems, Parallel Computation, Programming Languages, Data Structures and Algorithms, Graph Theory, and the Theory of Computation. I have taught all these courses at one time or another and I have developed projects for all of them.
